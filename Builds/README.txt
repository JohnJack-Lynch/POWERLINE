POWERLINE

-----------------

Congratulations! You are one of the few people with access to the first official build of POWERLINE!
This is still an early prototype so expect some jank, a few bugs, and what have you. Hope you enjoy!

-----------------

ABOUT

POWERLINE is a high-speed action platformer about using Jay's grapple beams to swing through stages at the speed of sound. 
Currently only 2 stages are available to play with more to come in the future. (NOTE: Records function is not implemented
at this moment in time. Apologies for the inconvenience.)

-----------------

HOW TO RUN

If you open the game for the first time and see the message:

"'POWERLINE' can't be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software."

- Either open System Preferences, click Security & Privacy, then click General, and click Open Anyway.
- Or, right-click (Control-click) on the app icon in the Finder window and select Open from the menu.
- Then click Open in the confirmation dialog.
- Enter your password if you're prompted.

-----------------

CONTROLS

Controller inputs are in parenthesis

Left/Right - Move
Down - Slide
Space (X/A) - Jump
Shift (Right Trigger) (hold) - Grapple
X (Square/Y) (while grappling) - Slingshot

About the Grapple Beam
- The beam by default will let you grapple onto any surface
- Its aim is a straight line ahead of you
	- Hold Up to aim upward at about a 45 degree angle
- This is overridden by the targeting system
	- If you see a blue lock-on icon on a object, you will shoot the beam at it
